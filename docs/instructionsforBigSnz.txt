UPDATE:

!!!New setup for credentials!!!

Take the info in your credentials.txt file from video above

Navigate to C:/Users/*YOUR_USER*/.aws

!!!YOU MAY HAVE TO CREATE THE.aws FOLDER!!!

Next, create a credentials file, names exactly "credentials" 

!!!CREDENTIALS CANNOT HAVE A FILE EXTENSION!!!

To remove any file extension, click view > show > filenameextensions

Rename credentials.txt ---> credentials

BELOW IS THE FILE FORMAT:

[default]
aws_access_key_id = ***PUT YOUR KEY HERE***
aws_secret_access_key = ***PUT YOUR KEY HERE***
